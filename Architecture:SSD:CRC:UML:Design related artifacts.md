### Propose End-to-End Architecture:

The end-to-end architecture of the Book Store application involves different components that work together to provide the required functionalities. Here's a high-level overview:

1. **Command-Line Interface (CLI):**
   - The primary user interface for the application.
   - Allows customers to interact with the system through commands.

2. **Catalog Service:**
   - Responsible for fetching book information from various catalogs.
   - Communicates with both the local database and external publishers' catalogs.

3. **Local Database:**
   - Stores detailed information about the books available in the store.
   - Allows quick access to book details without the need for external catalog searches.

4. **Book Store Application:**
   - Orchestrates the flow of information between the CLI, Catalog Service, and Local Database.
   - Handles user commands, searches, and order placements.

5. **External Publishers' Catalogs:**
   - Online catalogs provided by publishers.
   - Accessed by the Catalog Service when a book is not found in the local database.

### High-Level Flow:
1. **User Interaction:**
   - Users interact with the system through the CLI, providing search queries, book details, etc.

2. **Catalog Search:**
   - When a user searches for a book, the Book Store Application checks the local database first.
   - If the book is not found locally, the Catalog Service is used to search external publishers' catalogs.

3. **Display Information:**
   - The application displays detailed information about the book, including availability and price.
   - Users can choose to buy the book (if available) or place an order (if not available).

4. **Order Placement:**
   - For books not in stock, users can place orders, and the system records the order details.

### Technologies:
- **Language:** Ruby (for CLI application)
- **Communication:** HTTP/REST for external catalogs
- **Database:** SQLite (for simplicity in a small-scale application)

This architecture allows for scalability by easily integrating new publishers' catalogs and expanding the local database.


### Use Cases:

1. **Search for Books by Title:**
   - **Primary Actor:** Customer
   - **Goal:** To find detailed information about a book using its title.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Customer enters the book title.
     2. The system searches the local database.
     3. If found, the system displays book details.
     4. If not found, the system searches external catalogs and displays information if available.

2. **Search for Books by Author:**
   - **Primary Actor:** Customer
   - **Goal:** To find detailed information about books by a specific author.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Customer enters the author's name.
     2. The system searches the local database.
     3. If found, the system displays book details.
     4. If not found, the system searches external catalogs and displays information if available.

3. **Display Book Details:**
   - **Primary Actor:** Customer
   - **Goal:** To view detailed information about a specific book.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Customer enters the book title or author.
     2. The system searches and displays detailed information if the book is found.

4. **Buy a Book:**
   - **Primary Actor:** Customer
   - **Goal:** To purchase a book if it is in stock.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Customer enters the book title or author.
     2. The system checks availability in the local database.
     3. If available, the system processes the purchase.

5. **Place an Order for Out-of-Stock Book:**
   - **Primary Actor:** Customer
   - **Goal:** To place an order for a book that is currently out of stock.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Customer enters the book title or author.
     2. The system checks availability in the local database.
     3. If not available, the system prompts the user to place an order.

6. **Search by Publisher:**
   - **Primary Actor:** Customer
   - **Goal:** To find books from a specific publisher.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Customer enters the publisher's name.
     2. The system searches external catalogs for books from the specified publisher.
